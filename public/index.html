                    <p>My latest project: the containerized integrated development environment, can be seen on github. The other projects were either done specifically for a client, or were part of academic study as part of a team. In the latter case, I include notes from my faculty to provide context to that work, in lieu of the work itself.</p>

But even though my professor and I both had experience in this development environment, we found it challenging to share programs and configuration strategies given limited time and competing priorities. So I learned to containerize my development environment. Now anyone with Docker can try out my workflows with a couple programs (git, docker) in less than five commands, where previously it could take dozens of programs and commands.</span>

He had attended a meeting with the Team Entrepreneurship program and was able to translate their methodology into a systems approach. His work represents a synthesis of basic concepts from graph theory, communication, and systems theory. The origin of the work had several roots: 1. Brandon’s active participation in student governance, 2. Brandon’s interest in the application of systems theory to social systems, and 3. Brandon’s desire to improve communication and information flow in the Evergreen community.&rdquo;</span>

Their well-coordinated final presentation provided an organized overview of their process and a discussion of both obstacles and successes. Brandon provided leadership and empowerment to newer coders by guiding the group towards a process that emphasized an algorithm and descriptive understandings of what the code needed to accomplished, as well as developing the actual code and some of the details of testing strategies. The group embodied a learning community by making a commitment to make sure that everyone understood the algorithm and the code. Brandon also demonstrated their collaborative learning skills by helping two other groups on the project.&rdquo;</span>

I also went a little further and familiarized myself with the methodology and data used to identify our target demographics, which helped my team put our observations into perspective.
