**** Containerized Integrated Development Environment

:LOCATION: https://github.com/branjam4/doom-emacs-docker.git
:DESCRIPTION: I wanted to show some of the productivity gains and programs I had leveraged while learning how to use my development environment. But even though my professor and I both had experience in this development environment, we found it challenging to share programs and configuration strategies given limited time and competing priorities. So I learned to containerize my development environment. Now anyone with Docker can try out my workflows with a couple programs (git, docker) in less than five commands, where previously it could take dozens of programs and commands.

| June 2020     | Containerized Integrated Development Environment | https://github.com/branjam4/doom-emacs-docker.git | I wanted to show some of the productivity gains and programs I had leveraged while learning how to use my development environment. But even though my professor and I both had experience in this development environment, we found it challenging to share programs and configuration strategies given limited time and competing priorities. So I learned to containerize my development environment. Now anyone with Docker can try out my workflows with a couple programs (git, docker) in less than five commands, where previously it could take dozens of programs and commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
